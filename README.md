# My-Journal
An iOS app that stores your daily journal entries. 

### My Objective: 

I created MyJournal to solidify my understanding of full stack development when it came to iOS applications.
As fun as Firebase is Firebase comes nowhere near a custom built back-end.
Firebase comes with it’s own limitations that messes up the architecture of the app by clogging the client side of the application with 
code that’s suppose to be on the server-side.

## Technologies: 
1. Heroku
2. Passport.js
3. Cookie-storage
4. Cookie-parser
5. Body-parser
6. MongoDB
7. Mongoose
8. Node.js
9. Express
10. Bcrypt.js
11. Passport.js

## Languages: 
1. Swift

#### What can the app do?
1. I use passport.js to authenticate users with a local strategy located in the mongo cluster.
2. Allow users to post a video idea and list them in a collection view.
3. Ability to edit and delete each post.
4. A sidebar that is just a UIView that holds a logout button.



#### Below are some screenshots of the app
